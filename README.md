# Formant-based speech synthesis in Python 3.11.0

This is a random thing i worked on, it's a formant speech synthesis script in python.

Please note that it's made for Windows-style file paths, so you may need to tweak it when trying to run.

To run, do the command:
```pip install numpy scipy```

This has been barely debugged, so bugs may/will occur.

# What is it?
It is a custom formant-based speech synthesis system in python.

# Is it good?
I wouldn't say it is, but it's fine for a base or experiments.
